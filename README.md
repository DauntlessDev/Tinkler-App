# Tinkler
Tinkler is social media app which is also built with flutter with light and dark mode. With this app, users can express themselves and update their followers about their day in different ways. Users can search and follow each other while also chat their friends, post, like, comment and customize their profile. Users can use their facebook to login or create an account.

I'm extremely pleased with how the project came out and it also really opened my eyes how much effort developers give to build these kinds of app. At first, i thought that this would be small app, but when i started builting it, it is not easy as it seems but at the same, i really enjoyed it because it means i am learning.  I used a new architecture for the app which is very similar to MVVM called Stacked Architecture and with it my development process become much better and i was able to seperate concerns much better.
